# dlgs

I'm running python 3.7.13. The python packages we'll be using can be found in `../requirements.txt`.
I recommend making a virtual enviornment called `dlgs`, activating it, and then running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
The `requirements.txt` file, along with the rest of the repo, will be updated throughout the course.
